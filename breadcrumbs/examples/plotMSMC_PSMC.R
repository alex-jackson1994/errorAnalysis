### Plot with steps using ggplot - Ben (NOT NEEDED HERE)
# First recal that I changed your function at the start to not have the "points()" line, so it just created a list of
# twenty dataframes of bootstrapped data for each Bison type. lapply is a function that says "take the list of things" and
# perform some function on them. You said "take the list of file names" and "scaleMSMCInput them".
#TassieDevilDat <- lapply(TassieDevil_BS_files, scaleMSMCInput)
#Wooddat <- lapply(Wood_BS_files, scaleMSMCInput)
#Eurodat <- lapply(European_BS_files, scaleMSMCInput)

# I began by combining the MSMC data into one data.frame by "row-binding" them using rbind(). 
# whoops, deleted this part

EurBisMSMC # view it if you want...

# STUFF FROM BEN ABOUT GGPLOT
# I begin by making a ggplot() object called g1. I didn't define the data I'd use in the ggplot() part as it makes things harder later on. I prefer to do
# this when I'm layering plot on plot...there's an number of things going on here. I'll try and explain them in list, but you could find these on Hadley's
# documentation if you wanted.
# theme_bw(): makes the background black and white.
# in geom_step, size: the thickness of the plotted line.
# scale_y_log10(): Makes the y axis in the log 10 scale. This would through an error if any values were 0 (as log(0) in undefined).
# xlab(), ylab(): I use this to change the axis labels
# coord_cartesion: The range I will plot over on the x and y axes, defined by xlim and ylim as 2D vectors of the form c(min,max).
# theme(legend.title=element_blank()): Removes the ugly legen title.
# g1 <- ggplot() + theme_bw() + scale_y_log10() + geom_step(aes(x=alldat$scaledTimeLo,y=alldat$scaledPopSize),size=1, colour="purple", linetype="dotted") + ylab("Scaled Population Size\n") +
#   xlab(expression(paste("Scaled Time (mu = 1.25e-8)\n"))) + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(80,max(alldat$scaledTimeLo)),ylim=c(min(alldat$scaledPopSize)*0.9,1.1*max(alldat$scaledPopSize))) +

# l is just the number of bootstrap samples I add (defined by the number of data.frames in the list A1dat defined earlier)
