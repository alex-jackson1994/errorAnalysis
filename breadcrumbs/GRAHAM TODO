    Running MSMC. Link Graham the paper. Highlight the relevant parts, e.g difference from PSMC re: recombination rate estimates, time intervals. Highlight relevant command-line options, e.g. specifying time intervals. Give an example of how to run MSMC. (todo: me, Julien could help if needed later)
    Visualising MSMC. How to rescale the output to real-time, and how to visualise it. (todo: me. Julien or Ben if necessary later)

- should I include these things too?

    basic data visualisation things for after the runs have been done. I'm thinking not, Ben and Jono could do this much better than me, and this would be months away anyway.
    how to co-plot PSMC and MSMC runs. This would basically just involve me sending a commented R script.
    how to run PSMC on simulated and/or real data, and how to extract and visualise the output
