\section{Objective}
Determine if there's a relationship between the lengths of contigs being analysed, population model (predictors) and the error (response) given by PSMC' (MSMC\cite{schiffels2014inferring} with two haplotypes). This will probably be done using mixed effects models.

\subsection{Background}
PSMC' gives an estimate of how population demographics change over time, by analysing heterozygousity of sites across a genome. However, real sequenced genomes will not always be nicely sorted into chromosomes. Often they will be assembled into smaller sections called contigs. We will simulate human genomes (MSMC was originally written to analyse humans) under the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The length $L$ of the genome will be taken from a real human genome. For simplicity, only autosomes will be considered.
\item Four or five different population models will be considered. Take time $t$ as going from recent to ancient, i.e. $t=0$ is the more recent than $t=100$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Constant: $N_e(t)=N_0$.
\item Exponential: $N_e(t)=N_0e^{kt}$ for some realistic $k$.
\item Bottleneck: $N_e(t)=$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition Of Error}

\subsection{Potential Whole Genome Simulators}
We want a simulator with the following properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item Able to simulate exponential growth.
\item Able to be converted to a format which can be taken by MSMC.
\item Able to simulate selection pressure.
\item Able to simulate linkage disequilibrium.
\item Uses the coalescent model, not forward model.
\item Can handle human genome sizes (in the range of 2.6 Gbp).
\end{itemize}
A number of simulators were considered.
\begin{itemize}
\item msHot-LITE (\url{https://github.com/lh3/foreign/tree/master/msHOT-lite}): This was used by Heng Li in his PSMC paper to simulate genomes. However, it has an upper size limit of roughly 10 Mbp.
\item GENOME (\url{http://csg.sph.umich.edu//liang/genome/}): This doesn't appear to do exponential growth.
\item GenomePop2 (\url{http://acraaj.webs.uvigo.es/GenomePop2.htm}): This can apparently output in ms-like format. Might go back to it later...
\item MaCS (\url{https://github.com/gchen98/macs}): Looking at this right now.
\end{itemize}
